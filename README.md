# BIOF045: Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:-------------|:----------|
| Biologists | Basic R | 5-day workshop |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 5-day Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis. The
workshop focuses on teaching basic skills to use the command line interface, specifically `bash`, DNA sequencing,
RNA sequencing and the use of publicly available datasets.

- [Syllabus](Syllabus_Mar22.pdf)


### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash/shell).
2.	Perform DNA sequencing alignment and variant detection
3.	Perform RNA sequencing alignment and differential expression analysis.
4.	Access and use publicly available datasets.
